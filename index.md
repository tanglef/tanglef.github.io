## General

I'm currently a PhD student in Statistics in Montpellier, France.

I am under the supervision of [Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/), [Benjamin Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/index.php?page=index) and [Alexis Joly](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Alexis.Joly/wiki/pmwiki.php) at Institut Montpelli√©rain Alexander Grothendieck (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and the INRIA Montpellier.

You can contact me at:

## Research interests

* Applied Machine Learning - Deep Learning for image classification
* Label uncertainty in crowdsourced data
* Task difficulty for human classifications
* Applications in ecology and biodiversity
* Reproducible research and Open Science

## Other interests

* Programming in data science: mostly **Python**, some **R**. Could also be in the Research interests section, but clearly this goes beyond research purposes
* Running: Not an athlete, but it really helps to clear the mind
* Comic-books: Not data-science-related, but a very good escape from it all
* Plants: I have (quite) a few, and I'm trying to keep them alive
