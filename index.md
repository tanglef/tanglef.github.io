## General

I'm currently a PostDoc in Statistics in Lille, France at the INRIA under the supervision of [Odalric-Ambrym Maillard](https://odalric-ambrymmaillard.github.io/) in the SCOOL team.

I did my Ph.D (defense in 09/2024)n under the the supervision of [Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/), [Benjamin Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/index.php?page=index) and [Alexis Joly](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Alexis.Joly/wiki/pmwiki.php) at Institut Montpelli√©rain Alexander Grothendieck (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and the INRIA Montpellier.

## Research interests

* Label uncertainty in crowdsourced data
* Computer vision
* Recommender systems with crowdsourcing
* Task difficulty for human classifications
* Applications in ecology and biodiversity
* Reproducible research and Open Science
* Applied Machine Learning - Deep Learning for image classification

## Other interests

* Programming in data science: mostly **Python**, some **R**. Could also be in the Research interests section, but clearly this goes beyond research purposes
* Running: Not an athlete, but it really helps to clear the mind
* Comic-books: Not data-science-related, but a very good escape from it all
* Plants: I have (quite) a few, and I'm trying to keep them alive
