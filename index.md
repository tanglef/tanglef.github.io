## General

I'm currently a student in second year of a **master's degree in biostatistics** in Montpellier, France.

You can contact me at any of the following:

* [tanguy_l@outlook.fr](mailto:tanguy_l@outlook.fr)


## Interests

* Programming in data science: I like to play around with different programming tools, in **R** or **Python** mostly. This lets me see some practical uses first and then I inquire myself about the theoretical aspects (my main background being in maths)... And return on the dataset afterwards to try them. I try to use different datasets like the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to use images or the [OSMI tech surveys](https://osmihelp.org/) on the mental health in the tech-related industry amongst other standard ones.

* Scientific vulgarization: 
    * in books: Ian Stewart with *Flatterland*, the sequel of the famous *Flatland* or *The mathematics of life* by the same author, *The godess of small victories* by Yannick Grannec...
    * in videos: [Dimensions](http://www.dimensions-math.org/) and its brother [Chaos](https://www.chaos-math.org/fr.html), [Sciences Ã©tonnantes](https://scienceetonnante.com/)...

* Comic-books: Not data-science-related, but a very good escape from it all.
